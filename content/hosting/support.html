<h1>Hosting Support</h1>
<h2>I think something is broken!</h2>
<p>First visit: <a href="http://status.ithought.org/">status.ithought.org</a> to see if any known issues are listed. If everything listed there is in GOOD status and you are still having trouble, please send me an e-mail.</p>

<h2>I want to call you to ask about a problem!</h2>
<p>Phone support is not included in any of our hosting plans. If someone charges you $200/year and offers free phone support, they are cutting corners somewhere and not telling you the full story. Phone Support is available on a paid basis: Each Support incident is $100 for the first hour rounded up to the hour, and $100/hour for additional hours rounded up to the next 30-min interval. E-mail if you need a support phone call</p>

<h2>How do I set up my files?</h2>
<p>In your home folder on the server are folders for each of your domain names. Inside of them are "htdocs" folders which is the root level folder for that domain name.  Any files that you want to be on your website should be inside this folder.  All directories should have their permissions be set to 550 and all files should have their's set to 440. If for any reason you have a PHP program that should be able to write to a directory, that directory's permissions should be 750 and any writable files should be set to 640. (Technical description of what's going on: Apache is running as the Apache user which is in your group, so it can access things as your group. However, PHP runs as your user, so anything PHP does will be bound by the permissions of the files as related to you. This adds a bit of security, and if you make sure that none of your files are world or group writable, if a website on the same server as you is hacked there is no easy way for the hackers to damage your website.) Note: .htaccess files must be readable by your group or your site will not work.</p>

<h2>I want to let people know I'm using your services, how do I let them know?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking! Linking to ithought.org is a great start, and here are two images you can use to link here:
<img style="margin: 10px;" src="/img/ithought.gif" alt="ithought.org"><br />
<img style="margin: 10px;" src="/img/ithought_border.gif" alt="ithought.org">
</p>

<h2>I need to make a payment</h2>
<p>You can mail a check (email ithought for the address if you need it) or pay online using your credit card using the link you receive in your invoice e-mail.

<h2>I think my payment will be late</h2>
<p>If you think you might miss your deadline, please contact ithought. Payments 1-30 days late will receive no interruption of service but may carry a 10% late fee. If payment is not received by 30 days after it was due, your website, e-mail, and access may be disabled, and you may be charged a 25% late fee. If payment is not received within 60 days of it's due date, your access may be disabled and all of your information may be removed from our servers at our discretion.</p>

<h2>I am paying by check</h2>
<p>Please make all checks payable to "ithought"</p>
<p>When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us to use information from the check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account, or to process the payment as a check transaction. You authorize us to collect a fee of $30 (plus a bank fee charged to the merchant if allowed by your state law) through electronic fund transfer from your account if your payment is returned unpaid.</p>
