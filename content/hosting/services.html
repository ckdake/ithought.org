<h1>Hosting Services</h1>
<h2>Dedicated Servers</h2>
<p>Need your own server? ithought can rack your equipment and give you great rates on rack space and bandwidth, starting at $75/month for a 1U server. ithought can also take care of purchasing Dell hardware for you and you can either pay for it upfront, or spread your cost over several years. </p>
<h2>Shared Hosting</h2>

<p>Starting at $200/year, ithought's shared hosting package covers just about everything you would want to do on a PHP/MySQL server The following is all included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apache 2 virtual hosts for one domain and its subdomains (including weekly offsite backups of your files)</li>
