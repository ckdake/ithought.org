<h1>Hosting Services</h1>
<h2>Dedicated Servers</h2>
<p>Need your own server? ithought can manage everything for you, starting at $75/month for a dedicated server.</p>

<h2>Shared Hosting</h2>
<p>Starting at $250/year, ithought's shared hosting package covers just about everything you would want to do on a PHP/MySQL server The following is all included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apache 2 virtual hosts for one domain and its subdomains, including SSL certificates.</li>

This generally means several Gigabytes of disk and several Gigabytes of disk transfer per month.
