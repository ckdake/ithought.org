<h1>Hosting Platform</h1>

<p>Your site or services will run on top-of-the-line systems, with continually expanding capacity for future growth requirements. All software is secured and reviewed regularly for performance and security enhancements.</p>
<p>Ithought has moved from a colocation facility in Atlanta to cloud servers from Digital Ocean. This enables quicker responses to traffic spikes and outages recovery, and the ability to offer dedicated environments for lower prices.</p>

<p>On top of the basics, I provide:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Onsite and offsite backups of files and databases.</li>
	<li>Cloud e-mail hosting from Rackspace.</li>
	<li>Remote monitoring of all systems and services from another datacenter.</li>
	<li>Hardware RAID systems in every server.</li>
	<li>SSL, DNSSEC, CDN, DDOS protection (when I manage your domain name).</li>
</ul>
