<h1>Hosting Signup</h1>
<p>Just e-mail <a href="mailto:ckdake@ckdake.com">ckdake@ckdake.com</a> what websites and subdomains you need hosted(and if you need me to purchase them for you), what you'll need as far as e-mail and MySQL database hosting, and anything else you can think of.</p>

<p>I'll reply back with login information, generally within 30 minutes if your e-mail is during business hours, and you'll be up and running. Your first invoice will be emailed to you following your login information, and for almost everyone it is $200/year.</p>
